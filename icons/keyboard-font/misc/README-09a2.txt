                           =======================
This document contains information about installing and using the two 
TrueType font files "Key Normal" and "Key Extended" Version 2.1

History
-------
The idea for the KEY font first came to me whilst I was writing a manual for
a program to calculate the Thermodynamic properties of STEAM.
Whilst writing the manual I got thoroughly fed up with reading lines like 
"Press <ENTER> to continue" and "Press <ALT>+<F2> to run setup".

The only solution was to create a font file which contained characters that
looked like keyboard keys!!. Having produced the font for the keys I wanted 
in the manual, this them sat on my hard drive for about a year, until one 
day when I was tidying my hard drive, I decided to complete the font!!!.

July 1995 - Added two new keys to KeyExtended. Different shape and sizes of 
"Backspace" and "Enter" Keys, this is to allow an alternative keyboard layout
to be produced.

March 1996 - Commercial version to be made available. Removed some of the keys 
in the Shareware version to encourage registration!

July 1996 - Changed name of Commercial version to Professional version.

February 2000 - Reinstated all keys to the shareware version.

Why are there two font files?
-----------------------------
The font was initially intended to fit in one file but For some obscure 
reason, I can't seem to be able to create a font above about 73K in size, 
well a font which does not crash the system with a message 
"Invalid TrueType font Detected" anyway!!. (Since when has Complex 
had the same meaning as Invalid??) 
The other reason for producing two files was to enable the selection of the
characters to be "intuitive" and not using the extended character code.
Hence the two font files, KEY-N.TTF and KEY-E.TTF were produced.

Registered Version
------------------
The registered version of the font includes all the keys removed from the 
shareware version! 
The Registered version is UK specific, for other contries, see the Professional 
version section below.

Professional Version
--------------------
The professional versions are available in several languages, (Please e-mail me 
for an upto date list). 
This is to accomodate the different keyboard layouts and is available from myself
The professional version includes additional keys with single characters on them 
e.g.a key with just an exclamation mark on it and a key with just a dollar.
Also this version is more intuative to use, the fonts register themselves as a
family of fonts allowing <Bold> to produce the extended characters instead of 
changing font.

Installation
------------
There are two ways you can install the font files, either to the windows 
system directory or to a separate directory.

Windows System Directory
------------------------
To install the two font files to the windows system directory do the 
following:-

1) In program manager, open the CONTROL PANEL Program
2) Open the FONTS Section
3) Press ADD..
4) Select the directory where the fonts are located e.g. A:\TRUETYPE
5) Press Select All.
6) Check the box "Copy Fonts to System directory"
7) Select OK
8) Close CONTROL PANEL.

Alternative Directory
---------------------
To install the two font files to an alternative directory do the following:-

1) Use FILE MANAGER to create the directory you want the font files to be in
2) Copy all the files from the distribution disk / directory to the font
   directory.
3) In PROGRAM MANAGER, open the CONTROL PANEL Program
4) Open the FONTS Section
5) Press ADD..
6) Select the directory where the fonts are located e.g. C:\KEY-FONT
7) Press Select All.
8) UnCheck the box "Copy Fonts to System directory"
9) Select OK
10)Close CONTROL PANEL.

The file KEYBOARD.??? has been saved in four file formats,and describes how
to get the not-so-obvious keys!

.DOC - Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0
.WW2 - Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0
.WRI - Microsoft Write
.RTF - Rich Text Format

Using the Fonts
---------------
The font height is twice the height of most of the keys, this is to 
accommodate the "Enter", "Numpad +" and "Numpad Enter" keys! If you have 
only a basic word processing package e.g. Windows Write, you will notice 
that when you only use the smaller keys, a large gap above the line 
containing the font.  For this reason, the fonts work best with an advanced 
word processor such as Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0. This is because you 
can change the paragraph height to an exact value.

Registration
------------
If you like the font and intend to use it, please register it, All it will 
cost you is £5.00 Stirling for the registered shareware version.
